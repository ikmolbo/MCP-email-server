- Maintains the email thread (keeps subject with Re: prefix)
- Sets proper email headers to show as part of the same conversation
- Excludes your own email address to prevent sending to yourself

To get recent emails, please CHOOSE ONE time filtering method:

OPTION 1: Use the timeFilter parameter (RECOMMENDED FOR CALENDAR DATES)
- timeFilter: "today" - Gets emails from today's calendar date (00:00 to 23:59)
- timeFilter: "yesterday" - Gets emails from yesterday's calendar date
- timeFilter: "last24h" - Gets emails from the last 24 hours (rolling window)

OPTION 2: Use the hours parameter (FOR TIME WINDOWS)
- hours: 24 - Gets emails from the last 24 hours (rolling window)
- hours: 48 - Gets emails from the last 48 hours

OPTION 3: Use date filters in query parameter (FOR CUSTOM DATE RANGES)
- query: "after:YYYY/MM/DD before:YYYY/MM/DD" - Gets emails between specific dates

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- For "today" (a calendar date), use timeFilter:"today" not hours:24
- For "last 24 hours" (a time window), use timeFilter:"last24h" or hours:24
- For unread emails, ALWAYS use "label:unread" not "is:unread"

You can also specify:
- category (optional): "primary", "social", "promotions", "updates", "forums"
- maxResults (optional): maximum number of results to return (default: 25)
- query (optional): additional Gmail search criteria
- autoFetchAll (optional): set to true to automatically fetch all results (up to 100) without manual pagination

- LABELS are custom tags in Gmail (like "unread", "important", "work", etc.)
  * To filter by label: include "label:X" in the query parameter
  * Example: query: "label:unread label:important" (NOT category: "unread")

Common search patterns:
1. Today's unread emails from Primary:
   timeFilter: "today", category: "primary", query: "label:unread"

- If there are more results, a nextPageToken will be provided
- To view all results at once (up to 100), use autoFetchAll: true

   Required parameter:
   - draftId: The draft's ID

7. SEND_DRAFT
   Sends an existing draft.
   Required parameter:
   - draftId: The draft's ID

TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
1. Create a draft with create_draft or create_draft_reply
2. Check the draft with get_draft or list_drafts
3. Update the draft with update_draft if necessary
4. Send the draft with send_draft or delete it with delete_draft

REPLY WORKFLOWS:
1. For replying to an email:
   - Use create_draft_reply which automatically handles:
     * Setting the correct subject with "Re:" prefix
     * Maintaining thread context
     * Setting original sender as recipient
     * Including proper headers for threading

2. For manual reply setup:
   - Use create_draft with threadId and inReplyTo parameters
   - You must manually handle subject formatting and recipients

Drafts are useful when:
- You want to prepare an important email before sending it
- You need to come back to an email later to finish it
- You need to save an email template for frequent use
- You want to review the content before sending

To create a draft reply to an existing email, use the create_draft_reply tool which handles all the necessary aspects of maintaining a conversation thread.

Required parameters:
1. messageId - The ID of the original message you're replying to
2. body - The content of your reply

Optional parameters:
- to - List of email addresses to override the original sender (defaults to the original sender)
- cc - List of CC recipients

- from - Specific email address to send from (using one of your send-as addresses)

Benefits of using create_draft_reply:
- Automatically adds the draft to the original thread
- Sets proper email headers (In-Reply-To, References) for threading
- Formats subject with "Re:" prefix if needed
- Defaults recipient to the original sender
- Preserves all thread context

Example workflow:
1. Read an email using read_email or find it using search_emails
2. Use create_draft_reply with the messageId and your reply content
3. The draft will appear in your Gmail drafts folder, properly threaded
4. Review or edit the draft in Gmail before sending
5. You can also manage the draft using other draft tools (update_draft, send_draft, etc.)

Note: This tool only creates a draft - the email will NOT be sent automatically.
You need to explicitly send the draft using send_draft or through Gmail's interface.

   attachment_management: {
      name: "attachment_management",
      description: "Manage email attachments",
      template: `
To manage email attachments, you can use the following tools:

1. LIST_ATTACHMENTS
   Lists all attachments in an email.
   Required parameter:
   - messageId: ID of the message for which to list attachments
   Result:
   - List of all attachments with their details (name, type, size)

2. SAVE_ATTACHMENT
   Saves an attachment from an email directly to disk in the configured DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER.
   Required parameters:
   - messageId: ID of the message containing the attachment
   - targetPath: Filename or relative path where the attachment will be saved (inside DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER)
   Optional parameters:
   - attachmentId: ID of the attachment (if not specified, will automatically use the first attachment)
   Result:
   - Information about the saved attachment and confirmation that the file was written to disk

TYPICAL WORKFLOW:
1. Get an email using read_email or search_emails
2. List its attachments using list_attachments
3. Save a specific attachment using save_attachment

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Save_attachment is the only approved method for handling attachments. It automatically manages:
- Downloading the attachment
- Base64 conversion
- Writing the file to disk
- Verifying proper file saving
- Security: All files are saved within the configured DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER

Example:
1. Identify an email with attachments
2. List the attachments to see what the email contains
3. Save the desired attachment using save_attachment with messageId and targetPath

Note: Attachments can be of different types: documents, images, archives, etc. The MIME type of the attachment indicates its format.

   },

   save_attachment: {
      name: "save_attachment",
      description: "Save an email attachment to the configured default attachments folder",
      template: `
To save an email attachment to the configured DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER, follow these steps:

1. Identify the email with the attachment
   - Use search_emails or get_recent_emails to find the email
   - Note the message ID (messageId)

2. List available attachments
   - Use list_attachments with the messageId
   - You'll receive a list of all available attachments
   - Optional: Note the attachment ID (attachmentId) you want to save
   - If there's only one attachment or you want the first one, you can omit attachmentId

3. Specify the target path
   - This can be just a filename or a relative path within the DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER
   - The file will always be saved within the configured DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER
   - Absolute paths outside this folder will automatically be redirected to DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER

4. Save the attachment
   - Use save_attachment with messageId and targetPath
   - Optional: Add attachmentId if you want a specific attachment
   - The attachment will be saved directly to disk at the specified location within DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER

KEY FEATURES OF SAVE_ATTACHMENT:
- Automatically manages the entire process from retrieving data to writing to disk
- Verifies file integrity after saving
- Creates necessary directories if they don't exist
- Automatically selects the first attachment if no ID is specified
- Security: Only allows saving files within the configured DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER

Example workflow:
1. Find the email with search_emails
2. Identify available attachments with list_attachments
3. Execute save_attachment with messageId and targetPath to save the file

Notes: 
- For large files, the saving process may take longer
- Always verify the file type to ensure it's safe to save
- If targetPath only specifies a directory, the original filename will be used
- If targetPath includes a filename, that will be used instead of the original name
- All files are saved within the DEFAULT_ATTACHMENTS_FOLDER for security reasons
